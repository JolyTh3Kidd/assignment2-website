        <h2>Nvidia RTX 4090 Founders Edition</h2>
        <p>There's nothing subtle about Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card. It's a hulking great lump of a pixel pusher, and while there are some extra curves added to what could otherwise look like a respin of the RTX 3090 (opens in new tab) shroud, it still has that novelty graphics card aesthetic. </p><br>
        <p>It looks like some semi-satirical plastic model made up to skewer GPU makers for the ever-increasing size of their cards. But it's no model, and it's no moon, this is the vanguard for the entire RTX 40-series GPU generation and our first taste of the new Ada Lovelace architecture. </p><br>
        <p>On the one hand, it's a hell of an introduction to the sort of extreme performance Ada can deliver when given a long leash, and on the other, a slightly tone-deaf release in light of a global economic crisis that makes launching a graphics card for a tight minority of gamers feel a bit off.</p><br>
        <p>This is a vast GPU that packs in 170% more transistors than even the impossibly chonk GA102 chip that powered the RTX 3090 Ti (opens in new tab). And, for the most part, it makes the previous flagship card of the Ampere generation look well off the pace. That's even before you get into the equal mix of majesty and black magic that lies behind the new DLSS 3.0 revision designed purely for Ada.</p><br>
        <p>But with the next suite of RTX 40-series cards not following up until sometime in November, and even then being ultra-enthusiast priced GPUs themselves, the marker being laid for this generation points to extreme performance, but at a higher cost. You could argue the RTX 4090, at $1,599 (£1,699), is only a little more than the RTX 3090—in dollar terms at least—and some $400 cheaper than the RTX 3090 Ti.</p><br>
        <p>Though it must be said, the RTX 3090 Ti released at a different time, and its pandemic pricing matched the then scarcity of PC silicon and reflected a world where GPU mining was still a thing. Mercifully, as 2022 draws to a close, ethereum has finally moved to proof-of-stake (opens in new tab) and the days of algorithmically pounding graphics cards to power its blockchain are over.</p><br>
