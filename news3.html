        <p><strong>Eco Girl by Ken Wilson-Max, Otter-Barry, £12.99</strong>

        <p><strong>Sometimes, I Just WON’T by Timothy Knapman, illustrated by Joe Berger, Macmillan, £12.99</strong>
        <br>Some days, everything goes to plan – but sometimes baths are awful, it’s too scary to pet the dogs in the park and we hate the taste of peas! A hilarious look at strong toddler emotions and navigating “just won’t”.</p><br>
        
        <p><strong>The Boy Who Dreamed Dragons by Caryl Lewis, illustrated by Carmen Saldana, Puffin, £12.99</strong>
